        <h3> <code> style </code> tag is used here to incorporate CSS into the HTML.</h3>

        (1) Incorporating external JavaScript file into the HTML file.
    
        Summation of numberes.
    
        
    
        <input type = "number" id = "num1" placeholder="Enter the first number: ">
        <input type = "number" id = "num2" placeholder="Enter the second number: ">
        <button id = "Addition"> Summation of Numbers </button>
    
        <p id = "result"> </p>
    
        By assigning src the location of the js file within the <code> script </code> tag, external JavaScript can be incorporated inside an HTML file. 
    
        (2) Incorporating JavaScript inside the HTML file internally. The "Welcome to the page alert" was done by using this method. 
        <script>
            window.addEventListener("load", function()
             {
                alert("Welcome to the page. The page has been successfully loaded.");
            });
        </script>
        By directly writing the code inside the <code> script </code> tags, JavaScript can also be used.
